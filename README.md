## **Objective**
The overall object of this project was to help Instacart uncover more information about their sales patterns in order to improve sales.  This inovolved performing an initial data and exploratory analysis of some of their data in order to derive insights and suggest strategies for better segmentation based on the provided criteria. 


**Key questions to answer:**
- What’s the distribution among users in regards to their brand loyalty (i.e., how often do they return to Instacart)?
- Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s loyalty status?
- Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customer’s region?
- Is there a connection between age and family status in terms of ordering habits?
- What different classifications does the demographic information suggest? Age? Income? Certain types of goods? Family status?
- What differences can you find in ordering habits of different customer profiles? Consider the price of orders, the frequency of orders, the products customers are ordering, and anything else you can think of.
